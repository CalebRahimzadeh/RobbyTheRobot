Brainstorm:

The system should clear cans
The system should Find cans
The system should detect the landing zone
Should stay within the landing zone.
The system should notify martians with three tones
the System should evacuate 
system should keep track of cans moved
After extraction the system should move back into the landing zone
The system should push cans out of landing zone.
should keep track of distance cans are moved
System should be calibrated 
The system should display the distance pushed.
The system should display the length of time to remove.
